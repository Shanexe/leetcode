/**
 * There are N piles of stones arranged in a row.  The i-th pile has stones[i] stones.
 *
 * A move consists of merging exactly K consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these K piles.
 *
 * Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
 * Output: 20
 * Explanation:
 * We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
 * We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
 * We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
 * We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
 * The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], K = 3
 * Output: 25
 * Explanation:
 * We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
 * We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
 * We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
 * The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= stones.length <= 30
 * 2 <= K <= 30
 * 1 <= stones[i] <= 100
 *
 * range dp
 * 注意要加一遍区间和，核心在第二个+=
 * dp[i][j]=min(dp[i][j], dp[i][t] + dp[t + 1][j])
 * dp[i][j]+=preSum[j]-preSum[i-1] for (j - i) % (K - 1) == 0
 *
 * preSum第一个元素值为0方便计算
 * 注意跳步可以用K-1
